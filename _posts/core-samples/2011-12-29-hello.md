This Jekyll introduction will outline specifically  what Jekyll is and why you would want to use it.
Directly following the intro we'll learn exactly _how_ Jekyll does what it does.

## Overview

你好！！


## Initial Setup

After [installing jekyll](/index.html#start-now) you'll need to format your website directory in a way jekyll expects.
Jekyll-bootstrap conveniently provides the base directory format.



## Next Steps

Please take a look at [{{ site.categories.api.first.title }}]({{ BASE_PATH }}{{ site.categories.api.first.url }})
or jump right into [Usage]({{ BASE_PATH }}{{ site.categories.usage.first.url }}) if you'd like.
